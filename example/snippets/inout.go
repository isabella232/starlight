// Starlight makes it easy to get values in and out of your starlark scripts.
// Just pass in pointers to values that you want changed, or callback functions
// that propagate data.

// In theory, starlight also returns all global variables set by the script, but
// in real programs, you need well-defined outputs for your calling code to act on.
// If I write a script that creates a variable called nate_is_awesome = 1337 ... your
// go code probably isn't going to care that the variable exists.

// The best way to do it is to write a "results" struct that you pass in, just
// as you would for any other function.
